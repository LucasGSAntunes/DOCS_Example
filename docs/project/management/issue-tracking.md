# **Issue Tracking**

[← Back to Main Page](../../index.md)

This document outlines the **Issue Tracking** process for managing and resolving issues throughout the project lifecycle. Effective issue tracking ensures that problems are identified early, tracked efficiently, and resolved in a timely manner.

## **1. Issue Identification**

| **Objective**   | Identify and document issues that may impact the project.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key Actions** | - Record issues as they arise during development, testing, or post-launch.  - Classify issues by severity, impact, and urgency.  - Capture detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs. |

## **2. Issue Prioritization**

| **Objective**       | Assign priority levels to each issue based on its impact on the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Priority Levels** | -**Critical** : Must be resolved immediately to prevent system failure.  - **High** : Needs urgent attention to avoid major disruptions.  - **Medium** : Important but does not affect critical functionalities.  - **Low** : Minor impact, can be addressed later. |

## **3. Issue Assignment**

| **Objective**   | Assign issues to the appropriate team members for resolution.                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key Actions** | - Allocate issues based on team member expertise and workload.  - Set clear expectations on resolution deadlines and outcomes.  - Provide necessary resources or information for issue resolution. |

## **4. Issue Resolution**

| **Objective**   | Resolve issues by implementing fixes or workarounds.                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key Actions** | - Address root causes of issues to prevent recurrence.  - Implement solutions and verify that the issue is fixed.  - Test thoroughly to ensure that the fix does not introduce new problems. |

---

## **5. Verification and Closure**

| **Objective**   | Verify that resolved issues meet the defined acceptance criteria and close them.                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key Actions** | - Review the resolution with stakeholders and the team.  - Confirm that the issue no longer affects the project or product.  - Close the issue once it’s resolved and communicate the outcome. |

---

## **6. Documentation and Reporting**

| **Objective**   | Maintain a record of issues, resolutions, and lessons learned.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key Actions** | - Update the issue tracking system with detailed information on each issue.  - Generate reports on issues, resolutions, and ongoing challenges.  - Use issue tracking data for continuous improvement and future project planning. |
