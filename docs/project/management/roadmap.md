| **Phase 1: Planning and Requirement Definition**   | Month 1            | - Map the core features: Identify and prioritize the essential features for the MVP.  - Establish resources: Ensure necessary technology and team members are in place.  - Identify success metrics: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success.                                                                          |
| **Phase 2: Design and Architecture**               | Month 2            | - Finalize design for screens: Complete designs for key user screens (login, dashboard, etc.).  - Define database structure: Establish the structure for user and content data.  - Create wireframes and prototypes: Design wireframes and interactive prototypes.                                                                         |
| **Phase 3: Initial Development and MVP**           | Month 3-4          | - Build initial version: Develop the first version of the system with core functionalities.  - Test essential functionalities: Ensure that user registration, login, and user management work as intended.  - Ensure system operations: Verify that the system operates smoothly, focusing on core features.                               |
| **Phase 4: Testing and Validation**                | Month 5            | - Validate MVP functionality: Ensure the MVP meets all requirements and performs well with real users.  - Identify improvements: Based on user feedback, identify areas for improvement in design and functionality.  - Perform performance and security testing: Ensure the system performs under load and adheres to security standards. |
| **Phase 5: Launch and Implementation**             | Month 6            | - Ensure system stability: Ensure that the system runs smoothly in production without major issues.  - Provide user training: Educate doctors and administrators on how to use the system.  - Prepare user documentation: Ensure end-users have access to user guides and support materials.                                               |
| **Phase 6: Continuous Iteration and Improvements** | Month 7 onwards    | - Make adjustments: Update the system based on user feedback and new needs.  - Release regular updates: Regularly update the system to fix bugs and add features.  - Expand the platform: Add new features, such as reports and integrations.                                                                                              |
