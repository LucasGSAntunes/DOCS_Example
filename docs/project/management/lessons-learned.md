## **Lessons Learned**

| **Lesson**                                                               | **Action**                                                                                                                                                   | **Result**                                                                                                                        |

| **1. Importance of Defining Requirements Clearly**                       | Clearly and precisely defining the requirements is essential for the successful execution of the project. Early documentation and stakeholder involvement are key. | Constant scope changes caused rework and delays. A deeper analysis at the beginning could have saved time and resources.                |
| **2. The Importance of Automated Testing**                               | The adoption of automated testing was a positive change to improve system reliability and maintenance.                                                             | Implementing automated tests ensures that changes do not break existing functionality, saving time in the long run.                     |
| **3. Dependency and Update Management**                                  | Use version control tools like `npm`to manage external dependencies and ensure compatibility across all system versions.                                         | By managing dependencies and versions effectively, compatibility issues were avoided and stability was ensured.                         |
| **4. Communication Between Team and Stakeholders**                       | Establish regular feedback meetings to ensure all stakeholders are aligned on project goals and deliverables.                                                      | Improved transparency, aligned expectations, and the ability to adjust priorities based on continuous feedback.                         |
| **5. The Value of Adequate Documentation**                               | Properly document each step of the development process, including system architecture, workflows, and API details.                                                 | Well-organized documentation made deployment and future updates faster and less prone to errors, facilitating new team member training. |
| **6. Scalability Planning**                                              | Implement scalability practices such as microservices and load balancing from the start to accommodate growth.                                                     | The system’s scalability improved, supporting more users and data without sacrificing performance.                                     |
| **7. The Importance of Continuous Integration and Automated Deployment** | Implement CI/CD pipelines for frequent integration and automation of deployments to ensure faster releases and error identification.                               | Continuous integration and automated delivery reduced production errors and improved team efficiency.                                   |
| **8. Challenges with Subscription Management and Payment Processing**    | Conduct detailed analysis, select payment providers carefully, and implement load testing and payment simulations.                                                 | Payment and subscription management became more efficient and stable, improving the user experience and system reliability.             |
