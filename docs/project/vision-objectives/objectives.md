[← Back to the Main Page](../../index.md)

The primary objective of this project is to **develop a real-time monitoring system** capable of detecting anomalies and potential failures in large-scale server infrastructures. The system will use machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns in server performance metrics, which may indicate potential failures or security threats. By implementing this system, we aim to enhance the reliability and availability of enterprise IT systems and reduce the time to detect and respond to issues.
