## Project Phases

| Phase                       | Objective                                               | Key Activities                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elicitation and Discovery   | Identify the needs and expectations of stakeholders.    | Collect requirements through interviews and market analysis. Identify challenges and opportunities. Define users and their key problems.            |
| Analysis and Consensus      | Refine and validate the collected requirements.         | Prioritize requirements based on feasibility and impact. Validate with stakeholders. Define success metrics.                                        |
| Declaration                 | Formalize requirements and establish a clear scope.     | Official documentation of functional and non-functional requirements. Define acceptance criteria. Create the initial backlog and product roadmap.   |
| Representation              | Create models and prototypes to visualize the solution. | Develop low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes. Model user flows and processes. Continuous feedback with stakeholders for adjustments.              |
| Verification and Validation | Ensure that the requirements are correctly implemented. | Functionality, usability, and performance testing. Review compliance with requirements and acceptance criteria. Adjustments based on test feedback. |
| Organization and Update     | Keep the project documentation organized and updated.   | Record changes and backlog evolution. Plan new iterations and refine requirements. Monitor system adoption and performance.                         |
