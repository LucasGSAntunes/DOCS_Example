# Project Overview

[← Back to Main Page](../index.md)

## Context

In modern IT infrastructures, ensuring the reliability and availability of servers and services is crucial. The growing complexity of server environments and the increasing volume of data generated by these systems have created a pressing need for real-time monitoring and proactive anomaly detection.

This project was initiated to address these challenges by creating a scalable real-time monitoring platform. The system will leverage advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to monitor server health, detect performance anomalies, and alert system administrators to potential issues before they escalate into failures.

The project's aim is to reduce downtime, increase operational efficiency, and minimize the need for manual intervention in server management, ultimately improving the overall stability of IT systems.

### Objectives and Scope

#### Objectives:

* Develop a scalable and efficient real-time monitoring system capable of tracking server health across a wide range of metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage, network traffic).
* Implement machine learning algorithms to analyze historical and real-time server data, detecting anomalies and predicting potential hardware failures.
* Design an alerting system that notifies administrators of detected issues through various channels, including email, SMS, and integration with messaging platforms like Slack.
* Create an intuitive dashboard to provide administrators with real-time insights into server status, trends, and health indicators, allowing for informed decision-making.

#### Scope:

**Included:**

* Real-time data collection from servers running various operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.).
* Integration with existing IT infrastructure tools such as Nagios, Zabbix, and Prometheus.
* Machine learning models to detect performance anomalies and predict potential failures based on historical data.
* Alerting system with customizable thresholds and multi-channel notifications.
* Visual dashboard for displaying server health and performance metrics.

**Not Included:**

* Monitoring of non-server infrastructure components such as databases, network devices, or virtual machines (though these may be included in future iterations).
* Full end-to-end security monitoring (the focus is primarily on performance monitoring and anomaly detection).
* Monitoring for non-production environments (e.g., development and staging environments).
