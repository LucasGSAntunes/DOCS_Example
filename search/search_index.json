By implementing this system, we aim to enhance the reliability and availability of enterprise IT systems and reduce the time to detect and respond to issues.</p>"},{"location":"project/vision-objectives/objectives/#2-general-objectives","title":"2\ufe0f\u20e3 General Objectives","text":"<p>The project seeks to achieve the following general goals:</p> <ul> <li>\u2705 Develop a scalable monitoring platform capable of tracking real-time server performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic).</li> <li>\u2705 Implement machine learning models that analyze historical and real-time data to predict hardware failures and detect performance anomalies.</li> <li>\u2705 Ensure seamless integration with existing IT infrastructure and monitoring tools, such as Nagios, Zabbix, and Prometheus.</li> <li>\u2705 Create a robust alerting system to notify system administrators of detected anomalies or potential failures.</li> <li>\u2705 Provide a dashboard interface for visualizing the real-time status of servers and system components.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"project/vision-objectives/objectives/#3-specific-objectives","title":"3\ufe0f\u20e3 Specific Objectives","text":"<p>To meet the general objectives, the project will focus on the following specific tasks:</p>"},{"location":"project/vision-objectives/objectives/#research-algorithm-development","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Research &amp; Algorithm Development","text":"<ul> <li>\ud83d\udd39 Conduct a literature review of anomaly detection techniques, with a focus on time-series data analysis and unsupervised learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering and autoencoders.</li> <li>\ud83d\udd39 Implement data preprocessing pipelines for cleaning and normalizing raw server performance data (e.g., handling missing values, outliers, and normalization).</li> <li>\ud83d\udd39 Train machine learning models to detect performance anomalies by analyzing server metrics in real time.
